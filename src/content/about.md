<h3 class="bg-primary">Kalastatic is a static framework for prototyping responsive sites, styleguides, and designing in-browser.</h3>


With Kalastatic we close the gap early between **visual design**, **content strategy** and **frontend development**.

It puts into practice [atomic web design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design) principles to produce a [living styleguide](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/09/how-to-make-your-code-easily-maintainable-with-living-style-guides) that can be used to guide back-end implementations in a framework agnostic approach.


We do have  <i class="fa fa-drupal"></i> [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) in mind and are positioning the project to co-exist with Drupal themes â€“ in particular [Kalatheme](https://www.drupal.org/project/kalatheme). However, it can be (and has been) used to build beautifully crafted static sites at [Kalamuna](https://www.kalamuna.com).

<i class="fa fa-flask"></i> _**Kalastatic** is currently experimental.
Development is not guaranteed backwards compatible at this time, and therefore not recommended for a production environment._


## Project Goals

1. Enable designers and front-end developers to focus on their craft instead of struggling with poorly documented CMS APIs and configurations.
1. Drive design thinking early in the project lifecycle by giving clients something they can see and understand.
1. Provide a litmus test against style regressions during development by using the prototype as a living style guide.
1. Accelerate development by using a workspace for front-to-back and back-to-front collaboration.
1. Craft small sites with fun and fury, not tedium and infinite clicks.
